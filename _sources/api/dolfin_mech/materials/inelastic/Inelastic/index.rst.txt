.. py:module:: dolfin_mech.materials.inelastic.Inelastic

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Inelastic Constitutive Laws.

   This module provides the base abstractions and specific implementations for
   inelastic material behavior within the ``dolfin_mech`` framework.

   It extends the basic elastic material definitions to account for:

   * **Plasticity**: Permanent deformations and yield surfaces.
   * **Viscoelasticity**: Time-dependent stress-strain relations.
   * **Damage**: Reduction of material integrity over loading cycles.

   The hierarchy is rooted in the :class:`InelasticMaterial` base class, which
   standardizes the handling of internal state variables.

.. py:class:: InelasticMaterial

   Bases: :py:obj:`dolfin_mech.materials.Material`


   Base class for inelastic material models.

   This class serves as a fundamental abstraction for materials where the
   deformation is not fully reversible and may depend on the history of
   loading. In the context of ``dolfin_mech``, this includes:

   * **Plasticity:** Permanent deformation after exceeding a yield stress.
   * **Viscoelasticity:** Time-dependent material response.
   * **Damage:** Progressive degradation of material stiffness.

   Inherits from :class:`Material`.

   Subclasses are typically expected to implement internal state variables
   (e.g., back-stress, plastic strain, or damage variables) and their
   corresponding evolution laws.
