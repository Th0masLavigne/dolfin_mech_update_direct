.. py:module:: dolfin_mech.materials.elastic.Porous

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Porous elastic material scaling implementation.

   This module provides a wrapper for elastic materials to scale their energy
   and stress properties based on solid volume fractions, common in porous
   media mechanics.

.. py:class:: Porous(solid_material, scaling='no', Phis0=None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`dolfin_mech.materials.elastic.Elastic.ElasticMaterial`


   Class representing a porous elastic material.

   Properties are scaled based on the solid volume fraction.
   In porous media mechanics, the apparent strain energy density and stresses of
   a representative elementary volume (REV) are often scaled versions of the
   underlying solid constituent's properties. This class facilitates that
   scaling, specifically supporting linear scaling by the initial solid
   fraction :math:`\Phi_{s0}`.

   The total energy and stress are computed as:

   .. math::
       \Psi_{porous} = \omega \cdot \Psi_{solid}

   .. math::
       \mathbf{\Sigma}_{porous} = \omega \cdot \mathbf{\Sigma}_{solid}

   Where :math:`\omega` is the scaling factor:

   - For ``scaling="no"``: :math:`\omega = 1`.
   - For ``scaling="linear"``: :math:`\omega = \Phi_{s0}`.
