.. py:class:: XDMFFile(filename, functions)

   Wrapper for dolfin.XDMFFile to manage multi-field output.

   This class simplifies the process of writing multiple FEniCS functions to
   a single XDMF file at each time step. It configures standard settings for
   performance and file size optimization.



   **Configuration:**
   - ``flush_output=True``: Ensures data is written to disk immediately (useful for monitoring).
   - ``functions_share_mesh=True``: Optimizes file size by storing the mesh topology only once for all functions (assuming a fixed mesh).

   :param filename: Path to the output file (e.g., "results.xdmf").
   :type filename: str
   :param functions: List of FEniCS Function objects to be saved.
   :type functions: list


   .. py:method:: close()

      Closes the underlying XDMF file handle.



   .. py:method:: write(time=0)

      Writes the current state of all registered functions to the file.

      Iterates through the list of functions provided at initialization and
      appends their current values to the XDMF file, associated with the
      given simulation time.

      :param time: The current simulation time.
      :type time: float
