.. py:module:: dolfin_mech.operators.loading.surfacetension

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Defines the SurfaceTension operators.

   surface-bound tension forces for finite strain (including area-dependent
   surfactant modeling) and small strain mechanical frameworks.

.. py:class:: SurfaceTension(kinematics, N, measure, U_test, tension_params={}, gamma_val=None, gamma_ini=None, gamma_fin=None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`dolfin_mech.operators.operator.Operator`


   Operator representing surface tension effects in a finite strain (large deformation) framework.

   This operator assembles the virtual work done by surface tension on a boundary.
   Surface tension acts as a membrane stress within the tangent plane of the deformed
   surface. It supports a constant tension coefficient or a surface-area-dependent
   tension (e.g., to model surfactant effects in lung alveoli).

   The virtual work of surface tension is given by:

   .. math::
       \delta \Pi_{surf} = \int_{\Gamma} \gamma \mathbf{P} : \nabla_s \delta \mathbf{u} \, d\Gamma

   where:
       - :math:`\gamma` is the surface tension coefficient.
       - :math:`\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{I} - \mathbf{n} \otimes \mathbf{n}` is the
         projector onto the tangent plane of the deformed surface.
       - :math:`\mathbf{n}` is the current unit normal vector.
       - :math:`d\Gamma = J \|\mathbf{F}^{-T} \mathbf{N}\| d\Gamma_0` is the deformed
         surface element (Nanson's formula).

   :ivar measure: Boundary measure (typically ``ds``).
   :vartype measure: :py:class:`dolfin.Measure`
   :ivar tv_gamma: Time-varying surface tension coefficient :math:`\gamma`.
   :vartype tv_gamma: :py:class:`TimeVaryingConstant`
   :ivar kinematics: Kinematics object for deformation variables.
   :vartype kinematics: :py:class:`Kinematics`
   :ivar res_form: The resulting residual variational form.

   :vartype res_form: :py:class:`UFL form`


   .. py:method:: set_value_at_t_step(t_step)

      Updates the surface tension coefficient for the current time step.



.. py:class:: SurfaceTension0(u, u_test, kinematics, N, measure, gamma_val=None, gamma_ini=None, gamma_fin=None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`dolfin_mech.operators.operator.Operator`


   Operator representing surface tension effects in a linearized (small strain) framework.

   In small strain theory, the virtual work is derived by considering the
   variation of the surface area approximated by the trace of the strain
   within the tangent plane.

   :ivar res_form: The resulting residual variational form.

   :vartype res_form: :py:class:`UFL form`


   .. py:method:: set_value_at_t_step(t_step)

      Updates the surface tension coefficient for the current time step.
