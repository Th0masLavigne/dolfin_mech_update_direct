.. py:module:: dolfin_mech.operators.poro.wpore

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Defines the Wpore and InverseWpore operators.

   Implement the variational
   contribution of pore-level energy for porous lung tissue, coupling fluid
   volume fraction changes with the overall poromechanical response in both
   forward and inverse finite strain frameworks.

.. py:class:: Wpore(kinematics, Phis0, Phis, unknown_porosity_test, material_parameters, material_scaling, measure)

   Bases: :py:obj:`dolfin_mech.operators.operator.Operator`


   Operator representing the pore-level energy contribution in a finite strain poromechanical framework.

   This operator models the energy associated with the fluid-filled pores
   (specifically for lung tissue) and its coupling with the solid volume
   fraction :math:`\Phi_s`. It assembles the residual term derived from the
   variation of the pore energy :math:`W_{pore}` with respect to the porosity.

   The fluid volume fraction is calculated as:

   .. math::
       \Phi_f = J - \Phi_s

   :ivar material: Porous wrapper handling material scaling.
   :vartype material: :py:class:`PorousElasticMaterial`
   :ivar measure: Integration measure (typically ``dx``).
   :vartype measure: :py:class:`dolfin.Measure`
   :ivar res_form: The resulting residual variational form.

.. py:class:: InverseWpore(kinematics, phis, phis0, unknown_porosity_test, material_parameters, material_scaling, measure)

   Bases: :py:obj:`dolfin_mech.operators.operator.Operator`


   Operator representing the pore-level energy contribution for inverse or linearized poromechanical problems.

   In this operator, the volume fractions :math:`\phi_s` and :math:`\phi_0`
   are assumed to be spatial-like quantities that require scaling by the
   Jacobian :math:`J` to recover reference volume fractions.

   The fluid fraction is mapped as:

   .. math::
       \Phi_f = J \cdot (1 - \phi_s)

   :ivar kinematics: Kinematics object.
   :vartype kinematics: :py:class:`Kinematics`
   :ivar measure: Integration measure.
   :vartype measure: :py:class:`dolfin.Measure`
   :ivar res_form: The resulting residual variational form.
